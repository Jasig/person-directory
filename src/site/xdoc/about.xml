            <p>
                The person directory service provides an interface for retrieving user
                attributes. There are implementations of the interface which provide
                easy access to attributes in both LDAP servers and relational database
                services accessible via JDBC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other implemenations allow multiple data sources to be used for the
                aggregation of a single set of user attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the PersonDirectory implemenations are designed to be easily
                configured using the <a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring
                IoC framework</a>.
            </p>

                This Maven generated site is targeted towards development of Person
